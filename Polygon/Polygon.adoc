= New to Polygon?

Polygon is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Polygon PoS supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

== What is a Blockchain?

Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Head over to https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/home/new-to-polygon/blockchain-basics/blockchain[Blockchain Basics]to read more.

== What is a Sidechain?
Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a "parent" blockchain, supporting transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

== Validator and delegator roles
On the Polygon Network, you can be a validator or a delegator. See:

* https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator[Who Is a Validator]

* https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-delegator[Who Is a Delegator]

== Architecture
If your goal is to become a validator, it is essential that you understand the Polygon architecture.

See https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/validator/architecture[Polygon Architecture].

== Components

To have a granular understanding of the Polygon architecture, see core components:

* https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/contribute/heimdall/overview[Heimdall]

* https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/contribute/bor/overview[Bor]

* https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/contribute/contracts/stakingmanager[Contracts]

== Codebases
